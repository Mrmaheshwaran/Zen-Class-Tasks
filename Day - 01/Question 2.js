// Question: Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

/* Answer
  Objects in Javascript are represented as a collection of key-value pairs.
  The key-value pairs are separated by commas.

  For example: Console.log({name:"Mahesh",age: 26, Dob: "06-06-1996"})

  If i need to print the age the code will work

  Console.log({name:"Mahesh",age: 26, Dob: "06-06-1996"}["age"])
